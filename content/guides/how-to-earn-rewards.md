Reward programs exist to attract informed testers, gather telemetry, and bootstrap communities. When approached systematically they can also become a meaningful income stream, especially if the project later retroactively rewards early contributors. This guide outlines a structured way to earn points and credentials on Galxe, Zealy, and Crew3 without burning out or risking Sybil flags.

**Design your contributor profile**

Before diving into quests, define what makes your participation trustworthy. Use consistent usernames across platforms, link a public ENS or Farcaster handle, and document your skills—smart contract auditing, content creation, validator ops—in a Notion page or GitHub profile. Galxe and Zealy campaigns often ask for social proofs or references; having a living portfolio speeds up verification and separates you from low-effort bots.

**Automate discovery but stay selective**

Hundreds of quests launch weekly. Use tools like Dewrk’s dashboard, Zealy leaderboards, and community-run spreadsheets to monitor new campaigns. Prioritize programs from teams with a track record—Arbitrum’s Arbiters, Optimism Quests, Fuel Guild, Scroll Builder League—because they frequently convert to token drops or paid grants. Skim the rules for Sybil filters (IP gating, KYC, quiz requirements) before committing time.

**Follow the high-value quest format**

Most platforms share a similar structure: on-chain task + social amplification + feedback. Aim to complete the on-chain component first (deploy a contract, provide liquidity, run a node) and document every transaction hash. Galxe frequently verifies actions using smart contract calls, so double-check you interacted with the right contract address. Zealy leans on proof-of-work submissions—recorded videos, tutorial threads, or bug reports. Crew3 blends both approaches and is popular for long-running contributor programs with escalating levels.

**Submit proof that stands out**

Treat every task submission like a micro case study. Attach explorer links, screenshots, and a short explanation of what you learned or fixed. If a quest asks for a Twitter thread, include metrics (impressions, engagement) to prove reach. For code-based contributions, push to GitHub and tag maintainers. Higher-quality submissions increase your approval rate and sometimes unlock invite-only quests with better payouts.

**Track points and cross-campaign streaks**

Maintain a spreadsheet that records the campaign, wallet address, points earned, completion date, and follow-up requirements (e.g., “claim credential after manual review”). Zealy and Crew3 often grant bonus multipliers for streaks, so set reminders to check in daily. Galxe issues NFTs or credential badges—collect them in an organized wallet and export metadata to IPFS or an analytics sheet; during retroactive distributions, having the full credential list ready is invaluable evidence.

**Respect anti-Sybil policies**

Projects increasingly disqualify farming behavior. Avoid reusing IP addresses across multiple wallets, and do not spoof social accounts. When a program requires video or voice submissions, deliver genuinely personal material. If you collaborate with friends, register as a team when possible so the organizers understand why multiple wallets share raw assets or node configurations. Staying compliant protects future eligibility and keeps the ecosystem welcoming to newcomers.

**Move from quests to ownership**

The highest rewards often come after the initial quest season ends. Stick around to help triage GitHub issues, co-host community calls, or translate documentation. Many teams invite reliable questers into ambassador groups or grant programs where payouts are denominated in cash or governance tokens. Keep a running changelog of your contributions and share it in applications or retroactive funding rounds like Optimism’s RetroPGF. This cumulative footprint turns questing from a speculative gamble into a durable consulting pipeline.

By combining consistent identity, targeted campaign selection, meticulous submissions, and ongoing community support, you maximize the upside of testnet reward programs. Dewrk tracks these signals across the ecosystems we list so admins can spot genuine contributors quickly—and so you can focus your time on the quests that actually matter.
